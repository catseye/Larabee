<h1>The Larabee Programming Language</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Larabee programming language, named after everybody's favourite
assistant to the Chief of CONTROL, is not a happy-go-lucky language.
Indeed no, it has plumbed the very depths of the bottomless pit of its own soul,
only to have its true nature revealed to it too quickly, the utter shock of this
<i>denoument</i> leaving it scarred and reeling.</p>

<p>You see, Larabee has borrowed the notion of <em>branch prediction</em>
from the realm of computer processor architecture, and has chosen to abuse it in
one simple but rather nasty way: the interpretation of each branch instruction is not
just <em>optimized</em> by the history of branches previously taken, it is
semantically <em>determined</em> in part by the history of branches
previously taken.
Each branch taken (or not taken) increments (or decrements) a value called
the branch prediction register (or BPR.)  The BPR begins the program at
zero; when the BPR is positive, tests are interpreted in the usual way,
but when the BPR is negative, the interpretation changes: the
"then" and "else" branches are swapped.</p>

<p>What's more, to prevent (or rather, to <em>stymie</em>) working around
this by, say, coding up a lot of branches dependent on constant data to
"doctor" the BPR to some extremely (high or) low value, no constant data
is allowed in a Larabee program.  This has the effect of making programs
highly dependent on their input.</p>

<p>But enough of this insipidly sentimental dada.  We must move on to
insipidly sentimental dada frought with errors and inconsistencies.  Woe!</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>Larabee programs are notated as S-Expressions, familiar from LISP or
Scheme.  This is not solely because I am too lazy to write a parser.  It is also
very fitting for a language which has all of the abstraction and finesse
of assembly code <i>sans</i> immediate mode.</p>

<p>Larabee forms are as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li><code>(op <var>op</var> <var>expr1</var> <var>expr2</var>)</code>
<p>Evaluate <var>expr1</var>, then evaluate <var>expr2</var>, then perform the operation <var>op</var> on the results.
Valid <var>op</var>s are <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>,
and <code>/</code>, with their usual integer meanings, and
<code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, and <code>=</code>
with their usual comparison meanings, with a result of 0 on false and 1 on true.
Division by zero is not defined.</p>
</li>

<li><code>(test <var>cond-expr</var> <var>expr1</var> <var>expr2</var>)</code>

<p><code>test</code> evaluates the <var>cond-expr</var> to get either true
(non-zero) or false (zero).  What happens next depends on the value of the BPR.</p>

<p>If the BPR is greater than or equal to 0:</p>

<ul>
<li>If <var>cond-expr</var> evaluated to true, evaluate <var>expr1</var> and decrement the BPR.</li>
<li>If <var>cond-expr</var> evaluated to false, evaluate <var>expr2</var> and increment the BPR.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, if the BPR is less than 0:</p>

<ul>
<li>If <var>cond-expr</var> evaluated to true, evaluate <var>expr2</var> and increment the BPR.</li>
<li>If <var>cond-expr</var> evaluated to false, evaluate <var>expr1</var> and decrement the BPR.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>test</code> is the lynchpin upon which Larabee's entire
notableness, if any, rests.</p>

</li>

<li><code>(input)</code>
<p>Waits for an integer to arrive on the input channel, and evaluates to that
integer.</p>
</li>

<li><code>(output <var>expr</var>)</code>
<p>Evaluates <var>expr</var> to an integer value and produces that
integer value on the output channel.</p>
</li>

<li><code>(store <var>addr-expr</var> <var>value-expr</var>
<var>next-expr</var>)</code>
<p>Evaluates <var>addr-expr</var> to obtain an address, and
<var>value-expr</var> to obtain a value, then places that value in storage
at that address, overwriting whatever happened to be stored at that address
previously.  After all that is said and done, evaluates to <var>next-expr</var>.</p>
</li>

<li><code>(fetch <var>addr-expr</var>)</code>
<p>Evaluates <var>addr-expr</var> to obtain an address, then
evaluates to whatever value is in storage at that address.  Not defined
when the currently running Larabee program has never previously
<code>store</code>d any value at that address.</p>
</li>

<li><code>(label <var>label</var> <var>expr</var>)</code>
<p>Indicates that this <var>expr</var> is labelled <var>label</var>.
Serves only as a way to reference a program location from another
location (with a <code>goto</code>;) when executed directly,
has no effect over and above simply evaluating <var>expr</var>.</p>
</li>

<li><code>(goto <var>label</var>)</code>
<p>Diverts control to the expression in the leftmost, outermost occurrence of
a label named <var>label</var>.</p>
</li>

</ul>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>Ah, the burning question: is Larabee Turing-complete?  The burning answer is,
I think, a technical and somewhat subtle "no".</p>

<p>But first we must address our subject's special way of dealing with the world.
As you've no doubt noticed, Larabee has "issues" with input.  (Somewhat interestingly,
this emotional baggage was not a direct design goal; it was an unintended consequence
of abusing branch prediction and trying to prevent it from going unabused.)
These issues will, it turns out, haunt the language unceasingly, day in and day out,
with despair and turmoil forever just around the corner.</p>

<p>A specific hullabaloo induced by Larabee's obdurately retrograde
(not to mention completely stupid)
input regime is that it's simply not possible to write a program in Larabee
which is independent of its input.  This alone may make it fail to be
Turing-complete, for surely there are many Turing machine programs
which are input-invariant, and these programs Larabee cannot legitimately
aspire to one day become, or alas, even emulate.</p>

<p>For example, input invariance is the underlying idea used in converting the
usual proof of the uniform halting problem into a (less obvious) proof
of the standard halting problem — you say, for any given input, that
we can find a machine that erases whatever input it was given, writes the
desired input on its tape, and proceeds to perform a computation that we can't
decide will halt or not.</p>

<p>The idea is also embodied in a traditional quine program, which produces a
copy of itself on its output, while talking no input. That is, it doesn't matter what input
is given to it (and this is often trivial to prove since the quine is generally witten in
the subset of the language which does not contain any input instructions.)</p>

<p>But Larabee can't do either of these things.  There is no Larabee
program that can replace its arbitrary input with some fixed, constant choice of
input.  And while you can write a quine, it will require a certain input to
produce itself — there will always be other inputs which make it
produce something different.</p>

<p>"So what!" you say, being of bold philosophical bent, "it's mere mereology.
Whether we consider the input to be part of the program or not is simply not
relevant.  Stop trying to confuse me with details and definitions when I already know
perfectly well what you're talking about."</p>

<p>Fine, let's say that.  The customer is always right, after all...</p>

<p>The problem, Wendy, is that Larabee is <em>still</em> not Turing-complete.
But there are subtler reasons for this.  Needle-fine, almost gossamer reasons.
Ephemeral reasons with a substantial bouquet; fruity, with notes of chocolate
and creosote.  I doubt that I can do them justice in prose.  However, it still
strikes me as a more promising medium than modern dance, I mean at least nominally
anyway.</p>

<p>The reason is basically that you need to know a lower bound on
how many tests and variable accesses a Larabee program will make in advance
of running it, so you can supply that many values in the input to ensure that
the <code>test</code>s in the program go where you want them to go.</p>

<p>(It should be noted that it was rougly at this point that Pressey reached one of the
peaks of his so-called "referential" period, in which he was apt to provide "commentary"
on his own work, in the form of interjections or asides, as if from the perspective of a
historian from a much later era.  Such pretentious interruptions were generally
not well received, except perhaps by the occasional loser such as yourself.)</p>

<p>To illustrate, let's try walking through an attempt to have Larabee make a computation.
Factorial, say.  In pseudocode, it might look like</p>

<pre>a := input
b := 1
while a &gt; 0 {
  b := b * a
  a := a - 1
}
print b</pre>

<p>Translating this one step toward Larabee, we find the
following misty wreck on our doorstep:</p>

<pre>(begin
  (store a (input))
  (store b 1)
  (label loop
    (begin
      (store b (op * b a))
      (store a (op - a 1))
      (if (op &gt; a 0)
        (goto loop) (nop))))
  (print b))</pre>

<p>Now, we can't use names, so we say that a lives at
location 1 and b lives at location 2 and we have</p>

<pre>(begin
  (store 1 (input))
  (store 2 1)
  (label loop
    (begin
      (store 2 (op * (fetch 2) (fetch 1)))
      (store 1 (op - (fetch 1) 1))
      (if (op &gt; (fetch 1) 0)
        (goto loop) (nop))))
  (print (fetch 2)))</pre>

<p>Now, we can't have constants either, so we hold our
breath and grope around in the dark to obtain</p>

<pre>(begin
  (store (input) (input))
  (store (input) (input))
  (label loop
    (begin
      (store (input) (op * (fetch (input)) (fetch (input))))
      (store (input) (op - (fetch (input)) (input)))
      (if (op &gt; (fetch (input)) (input))
        (goto loop) (nop))))
  (print (fetch (input))))</pre>

<p>...with the understanding that the appropriate inputs for this
program are ones that have 0, 1, and 2 in the right places.
Naturally, sadly, magnificently, other kinds of inputs will
produce other, most likely non-factorial programs.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have to give up hope of ever seeing the familiar shores of
our homeland again, bite the bullet and kick the <code>if</code>
habit:</p>

<pre>(begin
  (store (input) (input))
  (store (input) (input))
  (label loop
    (begin
      (store (input) (op * (fetch (input)) (fetch (input))))
      (store (input) (op - (fetch (input)) (input)))
      (test (op &gt; (fetch (input)) (input))
        (goto loop) (nop))))
  (print (fetch (input))))</pre>

<p>And, oh, actually, we don't have <code>begin</code> —
nor <code>nop</code>, neither.  Hooray!</p>

<pre>(store (input) (input)
  (store (input) (input)
    (label loop
      (store (input) (op * (fetch (input)) (fetch (input)))
        (store (input) (op - (fetch (input)) (input))
          (test (op &gt; (fetch (input)) (input))
            (goto loop) (print (fetch (input)))))))))</pre>

<p>Now, if you've been following that, and if you can imagine in the
slightest how the input will need to look for any given integer, to
produce the correct factorial result on the output — even <em>assuming</em>
you added a bunch of <code>test</code>s somewhere in the program and
fed them all the right numbers so that the important <code>test</code> turned
out the way you wanted —
then I needn't go to the extra trouble of a rigourous
proof to convince you that Larabee is not Turing-complete.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, you decide to be stubborn and you say well that might be
a very involved encoding you're forcing on the input but it's just an
encoding and every language is going to force <em>some</em> encoding on the input
so <em>duh</em> you haven't shown me anything <em>really</em>, I'd have to pull out the dreaded
ARGUMENT BY ACKERMANN'S FUNCTION.  However, I'd really rather not, as it's
late, and I'm tired.  Maybe later.</p>

<p><i>(later)</i>  OK, it goes something like this.  Ackermann's
function — which we know we need at least something that can do
better than primitive-recursive, to compute — has a lower-bound
complexity on the order of, well, Ackermann's function.
(This in itself seems to be one of those mathematical oddities that seems
wiggy when you first hear about it, then self-evident after you've thought
about it for a few months... and, if you are lucky, no less wiggy.)
So anyway, what does that imply about how many items would need to be
input to a Larabee program that computes Ackermann's function?  And what does
<em>that</em> imply about what you'd need to obtain that input in the first place?
Hmm?  Hmm?</p>

<h2>Trivia</h2>

<p>There is an implementation of Larabee written in a relatively pure
subset of Scheme.  I hesitate to call it a reference implementation, but
it seems I have no choice in these matters.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>It has come time to say goodbye to our subject, our illustrious monstrosity,
our glorious bottom-feeder,  our feel-good cripple of the year.  With such a
distressing burden to bear, what's a programming language to do?  Who could
begrudge it seeking comfort in the arms of an understanding
mistress, a bottle of bourbon, the Cone of Silence?  But even so, saving
such wretched constructions from their own self-annihilation, so we may all
learn from its example — this is one of the very reasons
we run this Home for Wayward Calculi, is it not?</p>

<p>Indeed.</p>

<p>This is the place where ordinarily where I would wish you a happy something or other.
But I shall graciously decline this time; it is all too clear that
there is simply no happiness left.</p>
